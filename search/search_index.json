Usage: ,cooldown cooldown remove Description: Removes the cooldown from a command. The cooldown can be one set from this cog or from inside the cog's code.

This may not remove all data about you, data needed for operation, such as command cooldowns will be kept until no longer necessary. Further interactions with [botname] may cause it to learn about you again. Example: - [p]mydata forgetme Usage: ,mydata forgetme mydata getmydata Description: [Coming Soon] Get what data [botname] has about you. Usage: ,mydata getmydata mydata whatdata Description: Find out what type of data [botname] stores and why.

Usage: ,mydata ownermanagement mydata ownermanagement deleteuserasowner Description: Delete data [botname] has about a user. This will cause the bot to get rid of or disassociate a lot of data about the specified user. This may include more than just end user data, including anti abuse records. Arguments: - <user_id> - The id of the user whose data would be deleted. Usage: ,mydata ownermanagement deleteuserasowner mydata ownermanagement setuserdeletionlevel Description: Sets how user deletions are treated. Example: - [p]mydata ownermanagement setuserdeletionlevel 1 Arguments: - <level> - The strictness level for user deletion. See Level guide below. Level: - 0 : What users can delete is left entirely up to each cog. - 1 : Cogs should delete anything the cog doesn't need about the user. Usage: ,mydata ownermanagement setuserdeletionlevel mydata ownermanagement processdiscordrequest Description: Handle a deletion request from Discord. This will cause the bot to get rid of or disassociate all data from the specified user ID. You should not use this unless Discord has specifically requested this with regard to a deleted user. This will remove the user from various anti-abuse measures. If you are processing a manual request from a user, you may want [p]mydata ownermanagement deleteforuser instead. Arguments: - <user_id> - The id of the user whose data would be deleted. Usage: ,mydata ownermanagement processdiscordrequest mydata ownermanagement allowuserdeletions Description: Set the bot to allow users to request a data deletion. This is on by default. Opposite of [p]mydata ownermanagement disallowuserdeletions Example: - [p]mydata ownermanagement allowuserdeletions Usage: ,mydata ownermanagement allowuserdeletions mydata ownermanagement deleteforuser Description: Delete data [botname] has about a user for a user. This will cause the bot to get rid of or disassociate a lot of non-operational data from the specified user. Users have access to a different command for this unless they can't interact with the bot at all. This is a mostly safe operation, but you should not use it unless processing a request from this user as it may impact their usage of the bot. Arguments: - <user_id> - The id of the user whose data would be deleted. Usage: ,mydata ownermanagement deleteforuser mydata ownermanagement disallowuserdeletions Description: Set the bot to not allow users to request a data deletion. Opposite of [p]mydata ownermanagement allowuserdeletions Example: - [p]mydata ownermanagement disallowuserdeletions Usage: ,mydata ownermanagement disallowuserdeletions mydata 3rdparty Description: View the End User Data statements of each 3rd-party module. This will send an attachment with the End User Data statements of all loaded 3rd party cogs. Example: - [p]mydata 3rdparty Usage: ,mydata 3rdparty embedset Description: Commands for toggling embeds on or off. This setting determines whether or not to use embeds as a response to a command (for commands that support it). The default is to use embeds. The embed settings are checked until the first True/False in this order: - In guild context: 1. Channel override - [p]embedset channel 2. Server command override - [p]embedset command server 3. Server override - [p]embedset server 4. Global command override - [p]embedset command global 5.

Arguments: - [command] - Checks this command for command specific embed settings. Usage: ,embedset showsettings embedset command Description: Sets a command's embed setting. If you're the bot owner, this will try to change the command's embed setting globally by default. Otherwise, this will try to change embed settings on the current server. If enabled is left blank, the setting will be unset. To see full evaluation order of embed settings, run [p]help embedset . Examples: - [p]embedset command info - Clears command specific embed settings for 'info'. - [p]embedset command info False - Disables embeds for 'info'. - [p]embedset command \"ignore list\" True - Quotes are needed for subcommands.

Note: If content isn't passed, the message needs to contain embeds, attachments, or anything else that makes the message non-empty. Usage: ,mimicmsg debug Description: Evaluate a statement of python code. The bot will always respond with the return value of the code. If the return value of the code is a coroutine, it will be awaited, and the result of that will be the bot's response. Note: Only one statement may be evaluated. Using certain restricted keywords, e.g. yield, will result in a syntax error. For multiple lines or asynchronous code, see [p]repl or [p]eval. The code can be within a codeblock, inline code or neither, as long as they are not mixed and they are formatted correctly.

When there is one, it will send the update to all channels that have registered to recieve updates from that service. There's also the status command which anyone can use to check updates wherever they want. If there's a service that you want added, contact @vexingvexed or make an issue on the GitHub repo (or even better a PR!). statusset Description: Get automatic status updates in a channel, eg Discord. Get started with [p]statusset preview to see what they look like, then [p]statusset add to set up automatic updates. Usage: ,statusset statusset clear Description: Remove all feeds from a channel. If you don't specify a channel, I will use the current channel Examples: - [p]statusset clear #testing - [p]statusset clear (for using current channel) Usage: ,statusset clear statusset list Description: List that available services and ones are used in this server. Optionally add a service at the end of the command to view detailed settings for that service. Examples: - [p]statusset list discord - [p]statusset list Usage: ,statusset list statusset remove Description: Stop status updates for a specific service in this server. If you don't specify a channel, I will use the current channel. Examples: - [p]statusset remove discord #testing - [p]statusset remove discord (for using current channel) Usage: ,statusset remove statusset add Description: Start getting status updates for the chosen service! There is a list of services you can use in the [p]statusset list command. This is an interactive command. It will ask what mode you want to use and if you want to use a webhook. You can use the [p]statusset preview command to see how different options look or take a look at https://go.vexcodes.com/c/statusref If you don't specify a specific channel, I will use the current channel. Usage: ,statusset add statusset preview Description: Preview what status updates will look like. You can also see this at https://go.vexcodes.com/c/statusref The service you want to preview. There's a list of available services in the `[p]help statusset` command. **all**: Every time the service posts an update on an incident, I will send a new message containing the previous updates as well as the new update. Best used in a fast-moving channel with other users. **latest**: Every time the service posts an update on an incident, I will send a new message containing only the latest update. Best used in a dedicated status channel. **edit**: Naturally, edit mode can't have a preview so won't work with this command. The message content is the same as the `all` mode. When a new incident is created, I will sent a new message. When this incident is updated, I will then add the update to the original message. Best used in a dedicated status channel. Using a webhook means that the status updates will be sent with the avatar as the service's logo and the name will be `[service] Status Update`, instead of my avatar and name. Examples: - [p]statusset preview discord all true - [p]statusset preview discord latest false Usage: ,statusset preview statusset edit Description: Edit services you've already set up.
