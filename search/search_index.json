When each time the user asks a question, the previous embedding is replaced with embeddings pulled from the current question, this reduces token usage significantly Static embeddings are applied in front of each user message and get stored with the conversation instead of being replaced with each question. Hybrid embeddings are a combination, with the first embedding being stored in the conversation and the rest being dynamic, this saves a bit on token usage. User embeddings are injected into the beginning of the prompt as the first user message. Dynamic embeddings are helpful for Q&A, but not so much for chat when you need to retain the context pulled from the embeddings.

The prefix must not be entered. Usage: ,mimic mimicmsg Description: Dispatch a message event as if it were sent by a different user. Current message is used as a base (including attachments, embeds, etc.), the content and author of the message are replaced with the given arguments. Note: If content isn't passed, the message needs to contain embeds, attachments, or anything else that makes the message non-empty. Usage: ,mimicmsg debug Description: Evaluate a statement of python code. The bot will always respond with the return value of the code. If the return value of the code is a coroutine, it will be awaited, and the result of that will be the bot's response. Note: Only one statement may be evaluated. Using certain restricted keywords, e.g. yield, will result in a syntax error. For multiple lines or asynchronous code, see [p]repl or [p]eval. The code can be within a codeblock, inline code or neither, as long as they are not mixed and they are formatted correctly. You can upload a file with the code to be executed, or reply to a message containing the command, from any bot.

This includes codeblocks, and as such multiple lines can be evaluated. Use exit() or quit to exit the REPL session, prefixed with a backtick so they may be interpreted. You can upload a file with the code to be executed, or reply to a message containing the same command, for any bot.
