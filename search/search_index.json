All the commands in here have the potential to break the Audio cog. Usage: ,llset llset host Description: Set the Lavalink node host. This command sets the connection host which Audio will use to connect to an unmanaged Lavalink node. Usage: ,llset host llset secured Description: Set the Lavalink node connection to secured.
