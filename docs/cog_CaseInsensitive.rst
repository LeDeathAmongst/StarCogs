CaseInsensitive
===============

This allows prefixes and commands to be case insensitive (for example ``!Ping``
would be accepted and responded to).

Whenever the cog is loaded, prefixes and commands will be case insensitive.
This cog itself has no commands.

If you want to disable it in a certain servers, use
`[p]command disablecog CaseInsensitive`.

There are also other configurations, such as setting a default as disabled
and enabling per-server, listed under `[p]help command`.
