### quiz

**Description:** Play a kahoot-like trivia game.
Questions from the Open Trivia Database.

In this game, you will compete with other players to correctly answer each
question as quickly as you can. You have 10 seconds to type the answer
choice before time runs out. The longer you take to say the right answer,
the fewer points you get. If you get it wrong, you get no points. Only the
first valid answer (A, B, C, or D) will be recorded - be sure of the
answer before replying!

To end the game, stop responding to the questions and the game will time out.
