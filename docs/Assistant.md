### chat

**Description:** Chat with [botname]!

Conversations are *Per* user *Per* channel, meaning a conversation you have in one channel will be kept in memory separately from another conversation in a separate channel

**Optional Arguments**
`--outputfile <filename>` - uploads a file with the reply instead (no spaces)
`--extract` - extracts code blocks from the reply
`--last` - resends the last message of the conversation

**Example**
`[p]chat write a python script that prints "Hello World!"`
- Including `--outputfile hello.py` will output a file containing the whole response.
- Including `--outputfile hello.py --extract` will output a file containing just the code blocks and send the rest as text.

### assistant embedmethod

**Description:** Cycle between embedding methods

**Dynamic** embeddings mean that the embeddings pulled are dynamically appended to the initial prompt for each individual question.
When each time the user asks a question, the previous embedding is replaced with embeddings pulled from the current question, this reduces token usage significantly

**Static** embeddings are applied in front of each user message and get stored with the conversation instead of being replaced with each question.

**Hybrid** embeddings are a combination, with the first embedding being stored in the conversation and the rest being dynamic, this saves a bit on token usage.

**User** embeddings are injected into the beginning of the prompt as the first user message.

Dynamic embeddings are helpful for Q&A, but not so much for chat when you need to retain the context pulled from the embeddings. The hybrid method is a good middle ground

**Usage:** `<@1275521742961508432>assistant embedmethod`

### assistant mention
