Allocate a Discord voice channel to show the time in specific timezones. Updates every hour.<br/><br/>A list of timezones can be found here, though you should be able to enter any<br/>major city: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones#List<br/><br/>There is a fuzzy search so you don't need to put the region in, only the city.<br/><br/>The `[p]timezones` command (runnable by anyone) will show the full location name.

## ,timechannelset create
Set up a time channel in this server.<br/>

If you move the channel into a category, **click 'Keep Current Permissions' in the sync<br/>
permissions dialogue.**<br/>

**How to use this command:**<br/>

First, use the `,tcset short <long_tz>` to get the short identifier for the<br/>
timezone of your choice.<br/>

Once you've got a short identifier from `tcset short`, you can use it in this command.<br/>
Simply put curly brackets, `{` and `}` around it, and it will be replaced with the time.<br/>

**For example**, running `,tcset short new york` gives a short identifier of `fv`.<br/>
This can then be used like so:<br/>
`,tcset create üïëÔ∏è New York: {fv}`.<br/>

You could also use two in one, for example<br/>
`,tcset create UK: {ni} FR: {nr}`<br/>

The default is 12 hour time, but you can use `{shortid-24h}` for 24 hour time,<br/>
eg `{ni-24h}`<br/>

**More Examples:**<br/>
- `,tcset create üïëÔ∏è New York: {fv}`<br/>
- `,tcset create üåê UTC: {qw}`<br/>
- `,tcset create {ni-24h} in London`<br/>
- `,tcset create US Pacific: {qv-24h}`<br/>
 - Usage: `,timechannelset create <string>`
